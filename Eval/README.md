  
## Evaluation Conditions:

###  1. Justified Model Prediction
Experiment:
Make up 2 Models, One actually learns, other just happens to learn >>>> Both Same Accuracy
But with some Advarseraial attack, justified model is not suscebtible, whereas the other model suffers... 
(More Info on the experiment required)

### 2. All samples are not equally difficult
Experiment:
Simple Models can acheive 90% and BERT 92% , does that mean BERT is only capable of 2% increase
Furthermore on other datasets 80% performance achieved but BERT 90% <--- Descripency!!

### 4. ????


## Novel Ideas to be used:
1. Adversarial Attacks
2. Attention, BERT
3. Model Exaplnation like eli5...
